# Train Interior Designer and Simulator

You own a train. You get to design the layout of every car to maximize your passenger throughput whilst balancing comfort to keep a good reputation.

Choose routes to run your trains and optimize those trains for those routes and types of jobs. Running a subway will make you prioritize train acceleration, amount of doors, and seats to get a lot of people through. In a subway the passengers aren't as picky about comfort as they are about getting to their destination quickly. Running a long distance train will make you prioritize comfort, food, and entertainment to keep your passengers happy during the long journey.

You can buy new trains, add cars, and upgrade existing cars. You can sponsor stations to hope they can increase passenger throughput. You can also hire staff to keep your trains clean and maintained.
