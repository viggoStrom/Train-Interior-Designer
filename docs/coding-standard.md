# Coding Standard

### Note
As always, the ultimate coding standard doc is reading the code itself. This document is only trying to describe the rules, not prescribe them.

### JS naming
- Default to `camelCase` for variables and functions.
- Default to `PascalCase` for classes.
- Default to `PascalCase` for functions exposed in the DOM.

### File naming
- Folders are `kebab-case`.
- Files are `kebab-case`.
